Deploying a website locally with Express is fast and easy.

In this example, I'll show you how to install node.js and express and get a simple hello world application up and running. This tutorial is tailored towards Mac users.

Step 1: Install node
We'll use homebrew for this/ If you don't have a hombrew install I highly recommend. In your CLI, from the main directory enter the following
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
brew install node
